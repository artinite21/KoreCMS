![Kore CMS](https://github.com/Widecommerce/kore-cms/blob/master/KoreCMS/Media/kore-logo-dark.png)

## Intro

I am a freelancer and Kore is a web framework and CMS for ASP.NET MVC5 that I have been working on for the last few years. My customers seem pleased with it and I have decided to make it a public repository now for anyone who might find it useful. I am also currently working on a MUCH improved version for .NET Core, the name of which has been changed to MantleCMS for obvious reasons that Kore on .NET Core sounds a bit confusing. I will link to it here once it is ready.

## Tech

This project makes use of:

- ASP.NET MVC5
- Web API 2
- OData
- Durandal SPA framework (for the admin area - you can use whatever you want in the frontend)
- KendoGrid

As a 1 man team, you'll find my CMS is not quite as featured as many of the commercial solutions, but it is free and lightweight.

- Multi-tenant solution
- Plugins system
- Theme Engine
- File Manager (Responsive File Manager)
- Membership Management (manage users and roles)
- Localization
- Pages (and page types)
- Content blocks
- Blog
- Menus
- Sitemap Generator
- Scheduled Tasks
- and more...
