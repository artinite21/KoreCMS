![Kore CMS](https://github.com/Widecommerce/kore-cms/blob/master/KoreCMS/Media/kore-logo-dark.png)

## Intro

Kore is both a CMS and just a general purpose MVC5 web framework, built up with various extensions / helper classes. This is a project I have been working on for the last few years and I have now decided to make the repository public for anyone who might find it useful. I am also currently working on a MUCH improved version for .NET Core, the name of which has been changed to MantleCMS for obvious reasons that Kore on .NET Core sounds a bit confusing. Mantle uses [Aurelia](https://aurelia.io/) for the "Admin Area" and I will link to it here once I make it public.
